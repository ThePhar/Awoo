# Awoo ![GitHub package.json version (branch)](https://img.shields.io/github/package-json/v/ThePhar/awoo)

An automated real-time Werewolf game manager and moderator for Discord servers.

## What is this project?

Awoo is a discord bot that manages multiple games of Werewolf over a period of actual days and nights to give players 
the freedom to interact in the game throughout the day.

I created this project because I've been interested in running a Werewolf/Mafia-style game, but getting time to have
all of my friends sit down and put aside at least an hour to play has been getting increasing harder to accomplish with
all the responsibilities we have, so I created a bot to manage a game over the course of a real day.

## Features

I am currently in the process of refactoring this application, but I plan for all of these features in the **1.0** release of this build:

- No need for a moderator as all game management is handled by the bot.
- Real day and night cycle, so you have plenty of time to interact in the game once you are free.
- 20+ different roles for wildly different games each time you play.
- Configurable by server administrator to tweak most game settings on a per server basis.
- Games are saved server side so in the event of a failure, your game is safe and will pick back up where it left off when it restores.
- Ability to see an overview of a game through the **[Awoo.io](https://awoo.io)** website outside of Discord.

## Powered By

This project is powered by **Node.js** utilizing the **Discord.js** library. Developed in **TypeScript**.
